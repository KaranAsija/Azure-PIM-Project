# Azure-PIM-Project



##  **Project Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive theoretical implementation of **Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**. The project was undertaken as part of my final internship deliverable to demonstrate:

* Planning and configuration of **Just-In-Time (JIT)** privileged access  
* Management of **Azure AD roles and Azure resources** via PIM  
* Implementation of **approval workflows**, **break-glass accounts**, and **audit analysis**

Due to licensing constraints (absence of Azure AD Premium P2 in my student subscription), the project focuses on **detailed step-by-step theoretical configurations** aligned with industry best practices.

---

## **Objectives**

- Explain the **purpose and benefits** of PIM within an organization’s security strategy
- Configure **JIT access** for Azure AD and resource roles
- Enforce **approval processes** and time-bound activations
- Manage **Privileged Access Groups** efficiently
- Design and document **break-glass account strategy** for emergency scenarios
- Demonstrate **Eligible vs Active roles** understanding
- Analyze **PIM audit history** for compliance and security monitoring

## **Security Best Practices Implemented**

- Enforcing **Zero Standing Access (ZSA)**
- Mandatory **MFA** for privileged activations
- Short **activation durations** to reduce exposure
- **Approval workflows** with designated approvers
- Break-glass accounts with **strict monitoring and vault storage**
- Integration recommendations with **Azure Monitor and Sentinel**

## **Learning Outcomes**

Through this project, I:

* Strengthened my understanding of **cloud identity governance and privileged access management**  
* Developed structured documentation skills aligned with **industry standards**  
* Enhanced readiness for **cloud security and IAM roles** in upcoming placements
